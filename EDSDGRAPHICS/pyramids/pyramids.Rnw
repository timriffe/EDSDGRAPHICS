\section{Population pyramids}
By now you will probably have seen how to make populatin pyramids in Excel, but it's well worth your time to see a couple R-tastic ways of making them as well because 1) it's faster! 2) they are easier to standardize and make comparable and 3) it's way more reproducible. You might disagree with the first point, but actually if you already have your data in the shape required by Excel, then you have a few R functions at your disposal to make the pyramid in a single step. I'll present 2 functions, \texttt{pyramid} from the \texttt{pyramid} package by Minato Nakazawa and my own \texttt{Pyramid} function in the package \texttt{Pyramid}. For your information, there is also a pyramid plotting functions in the \texttt{plotrix} package, and there maybe others on CRAN as well. I show them both because they differ essentially in their plotting strategy. \texttt{}
