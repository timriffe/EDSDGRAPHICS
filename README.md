EDSDGRAPHICS
============

a short tutorial and R script for an EDSD lecture on graphics for demographers

This was written back in ye olde 2011, after I had been using R for 1.5 years. I'd do some things differently now. Soon I'll be writing a chapter in an introductory R for Demographers volume on the topic of plotting. It will probably be better than this, just FYI. I am abandoning this file. Please mine it as you wish, with attribution.
